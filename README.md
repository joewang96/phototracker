# phototracker
A data visualization project which allows users to view Instagram posts in the downtown Boston area.

To start up the code, open up the main project folder, labeled GUI_Version. Inside you will find the Processing files where the sketches are held. Open up the main one (GUI_Version) to pull up the main method. Hit run to launch the program.

Note: You will have to manually change the loadJSON method to change between pulling from the API or from the test JSON file I created (since the Instagram API only allows you to view your own posts under the Sandbox mode). Keep only one of the lines uncommented to load the masterJSON file (either line 71 or 72). If you have your own Instagram API code then you can substitute it in where I had my own code.
